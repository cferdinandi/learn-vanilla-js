<h1 class="text-xlarge margin-bottom-small">Learn Vanilla JS</h1>

<p class="text-large">{{%md%}}*Vanilla JS* is a term for coding with native JavaScript methods and browser APIs instead of frameworks and libraries.{{%/md%}}</p>

(*No, it's not another framework.*)

## Why should you learn vanilla JS?

There are so many powerful libraries and frameworks available. Why bother learning vanilla JS?

<p class="margin-bottom-small">Three reasons:</p>

1. It's better for web performance.
2. It provides a simpler developer experience.
3. If you *do* want to still use frameworks, it makes working with them easier.

Let's unpack each of these a bit.

### 1. It's better for web performance

JavaScript is the most expensive and fragile part of the front end stack.

Unlike HTML or CSS, which can run as soon as they're downloaded, JavaScript needs to be compiled and parsed. A 100kb JS file has a bigger performance impact than 100kb of HTML or CSS, or a similarly sized JPG.

That 30kb of React or Vue doesn't seem like much, especially in age of high-speed internet. But not everyone has 5G LTE, wired broadband, or the latest devices.

[Zach Leatherman ran a test to find out just how bad React is for performance:](https://twitter.com/zachleat/status/1169998370041208832)

> Which has a better First Meaningful Paint time?
>
> 1. a raw 8.5MB HTML file with the full text of every single one of my 27,506 tweets
> 2. a client rendered React site with exactly one tweet on it
>
> (Spoiler: @____lighthouse reports 8.5MB of HTML wins by about 200ms)

The 8.5mb HTML version is a 141 times larger than the React version. But because JavaScript is so bad for performance, it still loads perceivably faster.

That's bonkers!

### 2. It provides a simpler developer experience.

The modern developer experience sucks.

Imagine if you could just open up a text editor and a browser and start coding. No terminal window. No `npm install`. No build and compile steps. No webpack.

Just you and the code.

You *can* add more tooling to vanilla JS if you want. Sometimes it's helpful, particularly on larger projects or when working with teams. But the baseline, the barrier to entry, is so much lower.

A text editor and a browser. That's it.

### 3. If you do want to still use frameworks, it makes working with them easier.

Getting started with frameworks is *hard*. There's a lot of assumed knowledge in the documentation.

Understanding how these tools work under-the-hood makes them easier to learn. Understanding what the browser can do for you natively helps you write better code *with framework*.

A lot of people try to learn a framework, get stuck, and quit to focus on fundamental vanilla JS.

Once they feel comfortable, they go back to the frameworks, and find them a lot easier to learn.
