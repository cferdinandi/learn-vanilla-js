## The Roadmap

This isn't a comprehensive list. You don't need to learn these in order, or even learn all of them. You're still a "real developer" even if you only learn a few of these.

Think of these as some ideas to help you get started.

- **Beginner Topics**
	+ **Variables.** The difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`, and when and why you'd use one over the others.
	+ **Functions.** The different ways to create functions, and how they're different.
	+ **Strings.** How to create and transform strings.
	+ **Numbers.** How to create and transform numbers.
	+ **DOM Manipulation.** How to get elements in the DOM, make updates, and listen for events.
	+ **Arrays & Objects.** How they're different, when to choose one over the other, and how to edit and transform their data.
	+ **Browser Storage.** Saving data in the browser with `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies.
	+ **Dates.** How to get, set, and transform dates and times.
	+ **Scope.** Why and how to scope your code.
	+ **Progressive Enhancement.** How to build sites and apps that still work even when some of your code fails.
	+ **Polyfills.** How to bolt-in support for features in older browsers that don't natively support them.
- **Advanced Topics**
	+ **Promises.** Asynchronous functions in JavaScript, and when, why, and how to work with them.
	+ **Ajax & APIs.** How to get data from APIs and other external resources and integrate them into your sites and apps.
	+ **Plugins.** How to write flexible, modular, scalable plugins that grow with you and your users.
	+ **State-Based UI.** What is it, how its different from traditional DOM manipulation, and when and why should you use it.
	+ **ES Modules.** How structure and manage your scripts as your code base grows larger and more complex.
	+ **JS Testing.** How to test your JavaScript so that you catch issues _before_ your deploy to production.
	+ **Service Workers.** How to store assets offline and build progressive web apps.
	+ **Build Tools.** How to automate repetitive web development tasks.
	+ **Serverless & Microservices.** How to take advantage of server-based features without managing your own server.
	+ **Token-Based Auth.** How to authenticate users and manage browser sessions in client-side web applications.
	+ **Static Site Generators.** Get the benefits of database-driven sites and the performance and security wins of flat HTML.
